## Features

### Link Management System

This project includes a category-based link management system that allows authenticated users to save, organize, and retrieve links. Each user, including admins, can create their own categories and manage their own links within those categories.

**Key Features:**

*   **User-Specific Categories:** Each user can create and manage their own set of categories for organizing links.
*   **Link Management:** Users can add new links with a URL, title, and optional description, and assign them to a category.
*   **Filtering by Category:** The system allows users to filter their links by category, making it easy to find specific links.
*   **Secure and Private:** All links and categories are tied to a user's account, ensuring that they are private and only accessible to the user who created them.
